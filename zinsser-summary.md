# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Derick Nguyen

In these two chapters, Zinsser focuses on clutter in American writing.  The key to good writing, according to Zinsser, is simplicity.  He points out that people inflate sentences because there is a belief that if a sentence is too simple, there is something wrong with it.  Clutter is often seen in statements from corporations and the government, especially to euphemize their mistakes.  To write more effectively, sentences must be stripped down to only what is needed.  Many long words are just as good as the short word of the same meaning.
